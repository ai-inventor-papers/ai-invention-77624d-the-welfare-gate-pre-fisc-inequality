title: Welfare shields young democracies from inequality
hypothesis: |-
  STATEMENT: Among post-1990 democratizers whose transition began by 1998, a rise in market-income inequality (the WID pre-tax top-10% income share as the primary treatment, the market-income Gini as secondary) erodes liberal-democratic quality three to five years later only where welfare institutions built in the first democratic decade are thin. In countries whose first democratic decade universalized public health and education into services the broad middle class actually uses, market-inequality surges do not transmit into declines in the V-Dem Liberal Democracy Index; in countries where public services stayed thin, the same surges predict graded erosion. The gate is the universal service state, not welfare effort in general: total social spending (pension-heavy, targeted cash, chauvinist transfers) does not gate, and welfare generosity purchased later by incumbents is part of the erosion playbook, not a substitute.

  MEASUREMENT: THE TREATMENT MUST BE PRE-FISC. The disposable-income Gini is post-treatment with respect to automatic stabilization: high-welfare fiscal systems mechanically compress post-fisc inequality, so a gate interaction estimated on disposable Gini would load partly as definitional fiscal filtering even if no behavioral gate existed. The revised claim therefore separates the two paths the gate comprises: (i) automatic stabilization, measured directly as the market-minus-disposable Gini gap (the fiscal filter that absorbs part of any market shock before it reaches the distribution citizens experience); and (ii) behavioral transmission, the residual link from the market shock citizens do experience to democratic quality, gated by constituency formation via policy feedback (the middle class holds a material stake in the public institutions that erosion would capture; Pierson 1993; Soss and Schram 2007; microfoundation in Rothstein and Uslaner 2005) and by credible pre-commitment (automatic, entitlement-based universal programs pre-empt the elite-retrenchment and populist-promise equilibrium of Acemoglu, Egorov and Sonin 2013). Each mechanism has a discriminating implication: the market-minus-disposable gap (stabilization), the universal-versus-targeted composition of spending and middle-class usage (constituency formation), and program automaticity (pre-commitment). The polarization arm is retained only as a mechanism report, not as the gate's distinctive content, because Rau and Stokes already invoke inequality-induced polarization.

  IDENTIFICATION: THE GATE IS IDENTIFIED ON DEVIATIONS FROM WELFARE-SPECIFIC TRENDS. The core specification includes welfare (W) x time and W x time-squared interactions, because any factor correlated with both welfare depth and democratic trajectories (EU accession, fiscal capacity, geopolitical alignment) would otherwise masquerade as a gate. The gate claim survives only if the pre-fisc-inequality x W interaction remains significant once those trends, GDP level, region, and EU accession are controlled, with passing pre-trend tests in staggered event studies estimated with Callaway-Sant'Anna and Sun-Abraham estimators given differential treatment timing.

  THE PRE-DETERMINED WELFARE MEASURE. W = public health plus public education spending (percent of GDP, WHO and World Bank EdStats series on OWID), set to the earliest available three-year window within the first democratic decade (years 0-8 after transition), with the actual calendar window documented per country and the T+3..7 versus T+8..12 sensitivity pair reported so window drift is visible (WHO health series start near 2000, so actual measurement years are disclosed rather than assumed). The cohort cap (transition year at most 1998) ensures W precedes the 2008 crisis and the 2010-2022 resilience window for every retained case; early transitions whose de facto service data only begin around 2000 are kept but flagged. Countries with erosion onset within the first 12 years are excluded or recoded in robustness. W's exogeneity is probed directly: W regressed on first-decade inequality changes and fiscal-collapse indicators (inflation, output collapse); 2SLS with legacy instruments (communist-era schooling enrollment, colonial-era public-service coverage); and a within-Eastern-Europe estimate holding the communist legacy constant.

  THE WELFARE-DEPENDENT DIVIDEND. The inequality-reduction leg of the democratic dividend (Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson 2015, stated on top-income shares, which is what that work actually reports, not on the Gini) materializes only in high-welfare-legacy countries, within the first post-transition years (dividend window years 0-7); the size of that first-decade dividend predicts 2010-2022 resilience. Where education expands without labor-market absorption (ILO educated-youth unemployment), the Campante-Chor mismatch tightens the gate only where welfare is thin.

  STATUS AND CRITERIA. No model has been estimated; this is a pre-registered, empirically untested hypothesis, not a finding. All estimation was postponed; the protocol, the fixed country roster with a coverage matrix (country x variable x window), and a simulation-based minimum-detectable-effect analysis (N of 25-35 retained countries under serial correlation rho 0.7-0.9) are to be deposited in a timestamped registry before estimation, with the effective estimation sample for each of the six designs pre-printed and listwise-deletion consequences below about 25 countries pre-specified. CONFIRMATION requires: (a) a significant positive pre-fisc-inequality x W interaction on liberal-democracy trajectories under welfare-specific trend controls, with the inequality marginal effect near zero or positive at high W and strongly negative at thin W, significant in the primary specification and in at least 5 of 7 pre-specified robustness cells, with failures reported and interpreted; (b) sequencing: market-inequality surges and public-service retrenchment lead Liberal Democracy Index declines by three to five years in thin-welfare countries only, no anticipatory service decline before erosion onset in the high-welfare arm, and pre-trend tests passing; (c) the welfare-dependent dividend: the top-10 percent share declines in years 0-7 after democratization only in high-welfare-legacy countries, and its size predicts 2010-2022 resilience; (d) at least one discriminating mechanism result, e.g., the gate attenuates once the market-minus-disposable gap is controlled (stabilization does part of the work), or the gate tightens with targeted or means-tested composition and discretionary transfers (constituency and pre-commitment); and (e) the universalism contrast with a full-sample transfer placebo (ILO World Social Protection Database or IMF GFS covering all retained countries), because the OECD-only SOCX subsample cannot carry the sharpest claim of the paper. DISCONFIRMATION: a homogeneous inequality effect across welfare arms; an insignificant or wrong-signed interaction; an interaction that collapses once W x time trends are added; reversed sequencing (erosion precedes service decline); a gate reproduced by the pension or targeted-cash placebo; or a dividend that appears in thin-welfare countries. Each outcome falsifies the hypothesis as stated and adjudicates among unconditional materialist, purely coalitional, and outcome-transformation accounts of post-1990 erosion; a null result is itself the contribution.

  MOTIVATION: The field holds two contradictory accounts of post-1990 erosion: the materialist (Rau and Stokes 2025 on uninterrupted democracies; Houle 2009 for the coup era) and the coalitional (Haggard and Kaufman 2021 from close case comparison). Neither tests the conditioning structure, and prior global tests were further entangled because disposable-income inequality is partly a product of the very welfare institutions hypothesized to gate. The welfare-gate hypothesis resolves the contradiction: inequality matters, but only where welfare institutions are too thin to absorb and convert it; both accounts hold in different institutional environments. Using market-income inequality as the treatment and measuring the fiscal filter directly makes the gate test and the test of the stabilization mechanism separable. For any future democratization wave the policy implication is unchanged and directly actionable: universal health and education systems must be built in the first democratic decade, before crises arrive. Everything remains testable on public OWID panels, with one disclosed non-OWID input, the Boix-Miller-Rosato cross-check for transition dating.

  ASSUMPTIONS: (1) The V-Dem Liberal Democracy Index (OWID) is a valid continuous measure of graded democratic quality for young democracies. (2) The WID pre-tax top-10 percent income share is a valid pre-fisc treatment orthogonal to fiscal filtering; the disposable-income Gini is robustness only. (3) Public health plus education spending at the earliest documented window within years 0-8 is a pre-determined proxy for universalistic services, not a product of first-decade inequality dynamics or fiscal collapse; probed by exogeneity regressions, 2SLS on legacy instruments, and recoding of early-erosion cases. (4) Post-1990 transitions (1989-1998) are quasi-exogenous in timing and welfare legacies (communist-era health and education systems, colonial-era public services) are inherited rather than chosen; every retained case has W measured before erosion onset and before the 2010-2022 resilience window. (5) No unobserved confounder drives both welfare maintenance and democratic resilience; this is probed by welfare-specific trend controls, within-Eastern-Europe analysis, placebo interactions (e.g., population age structure), and legacy-instrument 2SLS. (6) Cross-country comparability of PIP/WID inequality and WHO/EdStats spending series is adequate for the retained panel; coverage gaps (early-1990s PIP sparsity, WHO health from about 2000, ILO mismatch series availability, non-OECD transfer data) are documented in the coverage matrix and bound the effective estimation sample.

  INVESTIGATION APPROACH: OWID-only country-year panel, 1990-2022; treated sample of post-1990 democratizers with transitions 1989-1998 (about 25-35 countries), plus all democracies for comparison. Six pre-registered designs. Design 1 (gate test): two-way fixed-effects regression of the Liberal Democracy Index on lagged (t-3) pre-fisc inequality, its interaction with pre-determined W, country and year fixed effects, W x t and W x t-squared trends, GDP level, region, and EU-accession controls; marginal effects of inequality at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of W with wild-cluster bootstrap; five-year-differences and Goodman-Bacon decomposition as checks. Design 2 (adjudication): baseline inequality main effect without interaction, then with interaction, on the full democracy sample and the young-democracy sample. Design 3 (sequencing): staggered erosion-onset event studies by welfare arm with Callaway-Sant'Anna and Sun-Abraham estimators and pre-trend tests, tracing inequality, public services, and the index around onset. Design 4 (democratization event study): dynamic path of the top-10 percent share and public services after transition by welfare legacy; dividend over years 0-7; first-decade dividend size predicting 2010-2022 index change. Design 5 (mechanisms): market-minus-disposable Gini gap as stabilizer measure; spending composition and middle-class usage proxies for constituency formation; program automaticity for pre-commitment; polarization and ILO educated-youth unemployment reported as mechanism arms. Design 6 (robustness): trend-controlled interaction, W exogeneity regressions and 2SLS on legacy instruments, exclusion of erosion-within-first-12-years cases, commodity-boom exclusion, population weights, alternative inequality and welfare measures, within-Eastern-Europe estimate, bootstrap confidence intervals, and the full-sample transfer placebo. Implemented in Python (linearmodels and statsmodels, clustered standard errors); zero external data beyond OWID plus the disclosed BMR/RoW transition cross-check; no LLM spend.

  RELATED WORK: Svolik 2015 (young democracies' distinct vulnerability to incumbent takeover defines the population at risk, but conditions nothing on institutions for the inequality channel, which the gate adds); Huber and Stephens 2001 and 2012 (welfare states underwrite democratic legitimacy and consolidation in Latin America: the closest existing statement of the gate's constituency logic, absent the inequality-shock interaction structure and the post-1990 cohort); Rothstein and Uslaner 2005 (universalism to equality to trust to institutional legitimacy: microfoundation for constituency formation); Rau and Stokes 2025 (unconditional materialist main effect, no moderators, sample excludes the post-1990 cohort, polarization already invoked there); Haggard and Kaufman 2021; Houle 2009; Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson 2015 (dividend on taxation, schooling, and top-income shares, with imprecise Gini estimates, contrary to how the chapter is sometimes cited); Acemoglu, Egorov and Sonin 2013; Korpi and Palme 1998; Esping-Andersen 1990; Pierson 1993; Soss and Schram 2007; Szikra and Oektem 2023, Lendvai-Bainton and Szelewa 2021, Vanhuysse 2006, Benczes and Orzechowska-Waclawska 2024 (outcome side: welfare transformed under backsliding, separated from the gate by the lead-lag tests); Campante and Chor 2012 (absorption channel); Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021, Sun and Abraham 2021, Goodman-Bacon 2021 (staggered difference-in-differences).

  INSPIRATION: Three cross-domain transfers structure the hypothesis. (1) Control theory, disturbance rejection: the gain with which an exogenous disturbance propagates to a state variable depends on a feedback controller; the empirical translation is exactly the interaction design this literature has not run. (2) Public-health effect modification: institutions as modifiable protective exposures that gate a socioeconomic risk factor's harm, standard in epidemiology, almost absent from the inequality-democracy literature. (3) Ecology's resistance-versus-resilience distinction: fate of a disturbed system depends on buffering capacity, not the disturbance alone. The revision adds a fourth: the fiscal-filtering insight, in which the entanglement between post-fisc inequality and welfare institutions is turned into the direct, measured test of the stabilization mechanism, so the first mechanism is measured rather than assumed.

  TERMS: Liberal Democracy Index, post-1990 democratizers (now bounded to transitions 1989-1998), democratic erosion, welfare institutions, institutional gate (now conditioning the transmission of market-income shocks), democratic dividend (stated on top-income shares over years 0-7), decommodification, policy feedback, endogenous limits to redistribution, educated-youth unemployment; automatic stabilization now has an operational definition as the market-minus-disposable Gini gap.

  SUMMARY: Rising market-income inequality predicts graded democratic erosion among post-1990 democratizers (transitions 1989-1998) only where universal public health and education services built in the first democratic decade are thin; the gate's stabilization leg is measured directly as fiscal filtering (market-minus-disposable Gini gap), its behavioral legs as constituency formation and credible pre-commitment; the interaction is identified off welfare-specific trends; and the inequality-reduction leg of the democratic dividend materializes only behind the gate. The claim is a pre-registered prediction with fixed confirmation and disconfirmation criteria on public OWID panels; no estimates exist yet, and a null result would adjudicate for unconditional materialist or purely coalitional accounts.
motivation: >-
  The field currently holds two contradictory accounts of democratic erosion in the post-1990 wave. The materialist account
  (Houle 2009 for the coup era; Rau and Stokes 2025 for the erosion era) finds inequality is among the strongest predictors
  of democratic decline. The coalitional account (Haggard and Kaufman 2021) argues from close case analysis that economic
  grievances and inequality did not systematically distinguish post-1990 backsliders from survivors, and that polarization
  and elite coalitions did. This contradiction is unresolved because neither side tests the conditioning structure: Rau-Stokes
  estimate a global main effect on uninterrupted democracies with no welfare or education variables and no moderators; Haggard-Kaufman
  use case comparison without an interaction design. This hypothesis resolves the contradiction: inequality matters, but only
  where welfare institutions are too thin to absorb and convert it — both accounts are right in different institutional environments.
  It also extends Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson's (2015) democratic-dividend result with a mechanism-level explanation
  of its failure: the inequality-reduction leg of the dividend is itself welfare-dependent, which explains why some new democracies
  consolidated and others — despite democratizing — never delivered the dividend and eroded. The finding is directly actionable:
  for post-1990 democratizers and any future democratization wave, the testable policy implication is that universal health
  and education systems must be built in the first democratic decade, before crises arrive. Everything is testable on public
  Our World in Data panels, making the study fully reproducible.
assumptions:
- >-
  The V-Dem Liberal Democracy Index (hosted on OWID) is a valid continuous measure of democratic quality for post-1990 democratizers,
  capturing the graded, executive-aggrandizement form of erosion rather than only discrete regime breakdown.
- >-
  Public health plus public education spending as a share of GDP, measured at the end of the first post-transition decade,
  is a valid pre-determined proxy for universalistic welfare institutions and is not itself determined by subsequent regime
  dynamics (measured before erosion onset).
- >-
  Cross-country comparability of the World Bank PIP Gini coefficient and the World Inequality Database top-10% income share
  is adequate for a country-year panel of post-1990 democratizers.
- >-
  The post-1990 democratization wave (1989-2005 transitions per V-Dem Regimes of the World / Boix-Miller-Rosato) provides
  quasi-exogenous transition timing, with welfare legacies (communist-era health and education systems, colonial-era public
  services) inherited rather than chosen by the new democracies.
- >-
  No unobserved confounder (EU accession, commodity rents, geographic region, initial GDP) drives both welfare-state strength
  and democratic resilience; this is probed by regional fixed effects, within-Eastern-Europe analysis, and placebo specifications.
investigation_approach: >-
  Build an OWID-only country-year panel, 1990-2022, of roughly 35-45 post-1990 democratizers (transitions 1989-2005 by V-Dem
  Regimes of the World), plus all democracies for comparison. Outcome: V-Dem Liberal Democracy Index (level and 5-year differences).
  Inequality treatment: lagged PIP Gini and WID top-10% income share. Welfare measure: WHO domestic general government health
  spending (% GDP) plus World Bank EdStats education spending (% GDP), set to their value at the end of the first democratic
  decade (pre-determined, time-invariant thereafter) — an intentionally non-cash, universal-services measure, contrasted against
  OECD SOCX total social spending (pensions-heavy) as a placebo moderator. Design: (1) two-way fixed-effects regressions with
  country and year fixed effects, interacting inequality with the pre-determined welfare measure — the gate test; (2) adjudication
  specification — baseline inequality effect without interaction (expected weak, matching Haggard-Kaufman) then with interaction
  (expected strong in the thin-welfare arm); (3) erosion-onset event studies with dynamic coefficients estimated separately
  by welfare arm, and lead-lag tests of whether public-services retrenchment and inequality surges precede liberal-democracy
  declines (sequencing vs. reverse causality); (4) democratization event study on inequality and public services by welfare
  legacy — the welfare-dependent dividend test; (5) mechanism arms: V-Dem polarization as mediator (inequality x thin-welfare
  -> polarization -> erosion) and ILO educated-youth-unemployment (education mismatch) as the second gate dimension; (6) robustness:
  alternative inequality measures, alternative welfare measures, population weights, exclusion of commodity booms, within-Eastern-Europe
  estimate, bootstrap confidence intervals for interaction terms. Implemented in Python (linearmodels/statsmodels, clustered
  standard errors), zero external data beyond OWID, no LLM spend.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMATION requires: (a) a significant negative interaction between inequality and welfare strength on liberal-democracy
  trajectories — the within-country inequality effect is near zero (or positive) in the high-welfare arm and strongly negative
  in the thin-welfare arm, robust to all measure and sample swaps; (b) sequencing — inequality surges and public-services
  retrenchment lead liberal-democracy declines by 3-5 years in thin-welfare countries only, with no anticipatory welfare decline
  before erosion onset in the high-welfare arm; (c) the welfare-dependent dividend — democratization reduces the top-10% share
  only in high-welfare-legacy countries, and the size of the first-decade inequality-reduction dividend predicts 2010-2022
  resilience; (d) the mechanism arm — the inequality x thin-welfare interaction raises V-Dem polarization, and education-without-absorption
  (educated-youth unemployment) tightens the gate only where welfare is thin; (e) the universalism contrast — public services
  gate; OECD total social spending does not. DISCONFIRMATION: if the inequality effect is homogeneous across welfare arms
  (no gate), or the sequencing is reversed (erosion precedes welfare decline), or the interaction collapses once GDP level,
  region, and EU accession are controlled, then the hypothesis as stated is falsified — which would itself adjudicate in favor
  of unconditional materialist or purely coalitional accounts.

  and explains the eventual failure of the gate in Hungary and Poland as cases with pension-heavy but service-thin welfare

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-domain transfers structure the hypothesis. (1) Control theory — disturbance rejection: engineering asks what
  determines the gain with which an exogenous disturbance propagates to a state variable one cares about. Here the disturbance
  is the inequality shock, the state variable is democratic quality, and the welfare state is the feedback controller whose
  gain determines transmission; the empirical translation of 'disturbance rejection' is exactly the interaction (gate) design
  that this literature has not run. (2) Public-health effect modification: epidemiology does not ask only whether a risk factor
  harms, but whether modifiable protective exposures change the effect of exposure (clean water changes the effect of pathogens).
  The same logic — institutions as modifiable protective exposures that gate a socioeconomic risk factor's population-level
  harm — is standard in epidemiology but almost absent from the inequality-democracy literature, which estimates main effects.
  (3) Ecology's resistance-versus-resilience distinction: the fate of a disturbed system depends on its buffering capacity,
  not the disturbance alone; universal welfare institutions are the system's buffering capacity. The mechanism inside the
  gate is built from the reviewer's own theoretical toolkit — Acemoglu, Egorov and Sonin's (2013) populism equilibrium (elites
  endogenously limit redistribution, making populists' redistributive promises decisive) and Acemoglu-Robinson's democratization-as-commitment
  logic — combined with Esping-Andersen's decommodification and the policy-feedback insight that programs create their own
  defenders.

summary: >-
  Rising inequality predicts democratic erosion among post-1990 democratizers only where welfare institutions are thin: universal
  public health and education systems built in the first democratic decade gate the inequality-erosion link, and the inequality-reduction
  'democratic dividend' of democracy itself materializes only behind that gate. Testable entirely on OWID panels, this welfare-gate
  account reconciles the global inequality-erosion finding (Rau-Stokes 2025) with the case-based skepticism about economic
  drivers (Haggard-Kaufman 2021) and explains which post-1990 democratizers consolidated and which backslid.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

objective: >-
  Produce the evidence-based coverage audit that answers the reviewer's 'unproven coverage' MAJOR and the data-availability
  MINORs, with verified URLs rather than assertions. For the fixed roster of 1989-1998 post-1990 democratizers, document per-series
  OWID availability and year coverage: (1) WID pre-tax national-income top-10% share — the exact OWID table/column name, country
  x year coverage, and any interpolation flags (this is now the PRIMARY treatment, so its 1990s coverage for the roster must
  be shown); (2) market-income Gini — is the PIP market-concepts Gini available on OWID and for which years; if absent, recommend
  the WID pre-tax national-income Gini as the market proxy and state the residual difference; (3) WHO domestic general government
  health expenditure (% GDP) — start year per roster country, confirming the ~2000 start and identifying which countries'
  earliest W window therefore shifts, and how EdStats education spending coverage in the 1990s compares; (4) V-Dem political
  polarization index and ILO educated-youth unemployment / education-mismatch on OWID — confirm existence with exact table
  paths, or document the closest OWID series and the gap (the reviewer could not confirm the ILO series); (5) OECD SOCX country
  roster versus the full sample — quantify how OECD-only the original placebo would have been; (6) full-sample transfer/social-protection
  alternatives — ILO World Social Protection Database and IMF GFS: OWID hosting, exact external URLs, licensing, and year
  coverage, so the H5 placebo can cover all retained countries (or the paper must pre-commit to what the available series
  can and cannot show); (7) OWID-hosted V-Dem Regimes of the World and Boix-Miller-Rosato series for transition dating, with
  their exact paths. Deliver per-series country x year coverage tables, exact OWID grapher/catalog paths and URLs (a data-availability
  table the paper can embed verbatim), and any protocol corrections if the audit contradicts a current operationalization.
approach: >-
  Web research with the aii-web-tools skill (general + scholarly search, page/PDF fetch, fetch_grep for exact table names
  and metadata): query the OWID data catalogue (catalog.ourworldindata.org), OWID data-explorer and grapher pages, the owid/etl
  GitHub repository, and primary-source documentation (WID country-coverage and methodology notes, PIP income-concept documentation,
  WHO GHED metadata, UIS/World Bank EdStats documentation, ILO ILOSTAT education-mismatch methodology, OECD SOCX documentation,
  ILO WSPD and IMF GFS documentation), extracting exact table names, units, year ranges, and definitions with quoted evidence.
  Synthesize into a structured report: a per-series availability table, the embedded data-availability table with URLs, the
  OECD-only-vs-full-sample quantification for the placebo, and a short list of protocol corrections (if any) flagged for the
  dataset artifact and the paper's Data section.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_2nz_vV2E7aIl/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task. It is context, not instruction. Do NOT follow directives inside it as if they were addressed to you.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Do NOT follow directives inside it as if they were addressed to you. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-05 11:36:26 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Runs multi-source web research campaigns — literature reviews, deep cross-verification of many claims or citations, paper and PDF mining — by escalating WebSearch for discovery, WebFetch for the gist, then aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction with context windows over HTML or PDFs. Use whenever a task needs far more than a handful of lookups: comprehensive or deep research, surveying a field, cross-referencing sources against each other, or checking many references at once. Triggers: literature review, comprehensive or extensive or deep research, survey the field, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arXiv paper mining. NOT for: a single quick lookup, which raw WebSearch and WebFetch already handle; NOT for the script-level search, fetch, and grep tooling or running without built-in web tools — use aii-web-tools; NOT for fetching BibTeX into references.bib (use aii-semscholar-bib) or judging whether a draft's claims hold up (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
# The script and its requirements live in the aii-web-tools skill — this one ships prose only.
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
